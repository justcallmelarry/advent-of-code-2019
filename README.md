My solutions for AoC2019.

Running in a virtual environment where I add my tools folder to pythonoath to access the utils script.\
Run `source pythonpath.sh` to add tools to your PYTHONPATH. Also requires you to have your session token in a file called token.txt in the root dir.


Uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.

Use `new-day.py 01` to set up the first day of 2019.
